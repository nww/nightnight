[nightnight.みんな](http://nightnight.みんな) (みんな is Japanese for "everyone") is a simple program that allows you to put your website to sleep, encouraging your users to go to bed, better supporting their health, wellbeing, and happiness.

The project was created by [Masamichi Souzou](http://mmsz.co) and built by the team at [Neeley Worldwide](http://neeleyworldwide.com). night night seeks to highlight the devastating public health implications of sleep debt, how technology contributes to these issues, and to engage technology creators with [New Kind of Design](http://nkd.is) and the concept of Universal Responsibility. We believe that technology creators must accept universal responsibility for the impacts of their design.

# Product Roadmap 

1. Create NPM Package
2. Fade colors through sunset, then to black
3. Explore options for individual sleep preferences and shift workers

# Demo

Your site works normally until the bedtime, and then goes to sleep. Users can click through to the site if needed in the night, and the site wakes up again in the morning.

# Install

There are two ways to install nightnight on your website. 

#### Quick Install

The first option is to simply drop in the single line of code below onto your website at the very end of the html page just above the `</body>` tag, and we'll do the rest.

```
<script async src="https://code.nightnight.xn--q9jyb4c/js/2200/0600/nightnight.js"></script>
```

And you're all set! Great work! You are taking a big step to care for your users and take universal responsibility for your design.



#### Self Host

The second option is to host all of the night night tool on your own site. You can do this by hosting the javascript on your own servers. 

```

https://code.nightnight.xn--q9jyb4c/js/2200/0600/nightnight.js

```


#### Time Adjust

If you'd like you can adjust the times of the quick install for wake and sleep for your site. We suggest 10pm `2200` for bedtime and 6am `0600` and as wake time default, but you can change these times in the script. For example if you want to sleep at 11pm `2300` and wake up at 6:30am `0630` then the script is adjusted to the following. 

```
<script async src="https://code.nightnight.xn--q9jyb4c/js/2300/0630/nightnight.js"></script>
```

# About

#### Sleep Debt
Sleep deprivation is one of the major health issues facing modern society.

> Sleep deficiency is a common public health problem in the United States. People in all age groups report not getting enough sleep. As part of a health survey for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 7–19 percent of adults in the United States reported not getting enough rest or sleep every day. Nearly 40 percent of adults report falling asleep during the day without meaning to at least once a month.  Also, an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans have chronic (ongoing) sleep disorders.

> Sleep deficiency is linked to many chronic health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression. Sleep deficiency also is associated with an increased risk of injury in adults, teens, and children. For example, driver sleepiness (not related to alcohol) is responsible for serious car crash injuries and death. In the elderly, sleep deficiency might be linked to an increased risk of falls and broken bones. In addition, sleep deficiency has played a role in human errors linked to tragic accidents, such as nuclear reactor meltdowns, grounding of large ships, and aviation accidents.

> A common myth is that people can learn to get by on little sleep with no negative effects. However, research shows that getting enough quality sleep at the right times is vital for mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety.

#### NKD

Current business & design practicies tend to optimize for profit and fail to consider the larger cummulative impact of these activities over time, which can inveitably lead to catastrophic collapse of systems, like the obesity epedemic, global finacial instability, and climate change. We believe new apparches are urgently needed. New Kind of Design is an approach that seeks to encorporate a number of methods into the design process that work to mitigate the catastrophic cummulative negative impacts of optimization of parts. 

For example, creators rarely consider the ALL of the implications of their designs, and this limited scope can significantly negatively impact the larger system. We believe creators have a universal responisbility to the entire system and to their individual users, which includes the users overall health and well being. This expanded purview leads to new and exciting opportunities for designers to support human and system needs in new ways.
